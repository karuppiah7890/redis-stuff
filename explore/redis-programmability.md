# Redis Programmability

From Redis Conf 2021 - https://youtu.be/unQydnwJkZ4?t=2704 , the different ways to extend Redis -

- Lua Scripts
- Redis Functions - in Redis 7
- Redis Gears (module) - paid?
- Redis modules

Redis Functions - https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8693

How does it differ from Lua? I keep seeing that Lua is managed by the client application. I gotta try it out and see I guess!

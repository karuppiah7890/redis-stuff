I was skimming through the section

I checked out about the different metrics that I had already seen a bit before when using `INFO` command

I had already heard of `MEMORY` and `LATENCY` Redis command too

I need to try some of this stuff!! [TODO]
- `redis-cli --latency`
- `redis-cli --latency --csv`
- `redis-cli --latency-history -i 60`
- `redis-cli --latency-history -i 60 --csv`
- `redis-cli --latency-dist`
- `redis-cli --latency-dist -i 60`
- `redis-cli --stat`
- `redis-cli memory stats`
- `redis-cli LATENCY DOCTOR`

and then read the `Latency Monitoring` section [TODO]
